> A simple node cli for brenda (the aws blender farm).

## Prerequisites
At this time you must have the orginal Brenda installed and working.

Follow the instructions at [https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda](https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda).

Once you have the *awesome* jamesyonan's tool working, you may continue... at your own risk.


## Getting Started
**UNSTABLE - This project is a work-in-progress!!**

To install the module, run the following in the command line:

```bash
npm install -g brenda
```

In terminal run the following command:

```bash
brenda status
```
This will run the underlying `brenda-work status` and `brenda-run status` and display the results.


## Usage Examples
`brenda status`

`brenda price`

`brenda render <file|folder>` (wip)


## Contributing
Find a bug? Have a feature request? Please [create an Issue](https://github.com/danielmahon/node-brenda/issues).

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality,
and run `docs` in the command line to build the docs with [Verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb).

Pull requests are also encouraged, and if you find this project useful please consider "starring" it to show your support! Thanks!
